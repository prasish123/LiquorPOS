# Priority 1 Changes - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Added

### 1. ✅ Problem Recognition Section ("Does This Sound Familiar?")
**Location:** After Hero, before Problem stats

**Content:**
- 6 emotional pain points matching the strategy
- Uses emotional language: "trapped," "terrified," "flying blind"

**Pain Points:**
1. 💰 Costs keep rising ($2,400+ annual waste)
2. 📞 Support is impossible ($500-1,500 lost per incident)
3. 📦 Inventory is killing you ($50,000+ wasted capital)
4. 🌐 Can't go omnichannel ($78,000/year lost opportunity)
5. 😰 Compliance anxiety (License worth $50K-500K at risk)

- Makes them feel UNDERSTOOD
- Uses their exact frustrations
- Quantifies the pain
- Creates emotional connection
