## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **Problem Recognition Section** ✅
**"Does This Sound Familiar?"**

Creates emotional connection with 6 specific pain points:

- 💰 **Costs keep rising** - "Your POS bill went from $350 to $450... You're trapped in a contract"
- 📞 **Support is impossible** - "Wait 2+ hours... Your store is down during rush hour"
- 📦 **Inventory is killing you** - "3,000+ SKUs... Overstock ties up $50K+"
- 🌐 **Can't go omnichannel** - "Your POS wants $5,000 per integration"
- 😰 **Compliance anxiety** - "Age verification bugs terrify you... One mistake = lose your license"
- 📊 **Flying blind** - "Reports take 5 minutes to load... Guessing on pricing"

**Impact:** Shows "$55,000+ per year" in total costs

---

### 2. **Comparison Table** ✅
**"How We Compare"**

14-row feature comparison showing LiquorPOS advantages:

| Omnichannel Setup | $5,000 per integration | **Included ($0)** |
