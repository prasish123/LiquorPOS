# Florida Liquor Store POS Implementation

## Planning Phase
- [x] Research NRS Plus competitor capabilities
- [x] Define core requirements for liquor store POS
- [x] Design simplified architecture (vs enterprise SRS model)
- [x] Create implementation plan with phases and budget
- [x] Define integration strategy with friend's back-office system

## Architecture Design
- [ ] Counter POS design (React PWA)
- [ ] E-commerce integration strategy
- [ ] Third-party delivery integration (Uber Eats, DoorDash)
- [ ] Payment processing integration

## Plan Refinement (Based on User Feedback)
- [x] Incorporate event-driven architecture (pub/sub for integrity)
- [x] Update back-office integration with 6 API files details
- [x] Clarify budget allocation (user coding with AI vs hiring developers)
- [x] Review user's existing architecture
- [x] Simplify event system to avoid over-complexity
- [x] Integrate user's orchestrator pattern and AI capabilities

## Structured Development Workflow
- [x] Create PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- [x] Finalize architecture decisions (FastAPI vs NestJS, Vector DB)
- [ ] Create developer implementation guide
- [ ] Define test strategy (regression + load testing)
- [ ] Create validation checklist

## Documentation
- [x] Create implementation plan artifact
- [x] Create architecture diagram
- [/] Define API contracts for back-office integration
